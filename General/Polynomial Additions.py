Q)  Write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program to add the two given 
    polynomials. Assume that the coefficients of each polynomial are stored in a 
    separate list.

    Eg: 4x^3 + 3x + 1 can be stored as [4,0,3,1]

        2x^2 - 3x - 4 can be stored as [2,-3,-4]

Output is [4, 2, 0, -3]

Input Format:

First line contains the degree of the first polynomial

Next line contains the coefficient of x^n

Next line contains the coefficient of x^(n-1)
.
.
.
Next line contains the coefficient of x^0
Next line contains the degree of the second equation
Next line contains the coefficient of x^n

Next line contains the coefficient of x^(n-1)
.
.
.
Next line contains the coefficient of x^0

Output Format:

Coefficients as a list from the highest degree to the lowest degree
