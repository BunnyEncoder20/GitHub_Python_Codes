Q)  A login register is maintained in the library of VITCC in which, the register
    number of students are recorded when they enter the library. Sometimes it 
    happens that the students visit the library more than once in a day and hence 
    duplicate entries occur so frequently in the register. The librarian wants to 
    have a report of all students who have visited on a particular day, ‘x’. Given 
    the list  of students who visited the library on the day ‘x’, write an algorithm
    and the subsequent Python program to prepare a report with unique register 
    number of students. Also read a register number ‘r’ and search for it in the 
    list. Print ‘Found’ if ‘r’ is in the list and print ‘Not found’ otherwise.

Input Format:
First line contains the number of students visited, ‘n’
Second line contains the register number of first entry
Third line contains the register number of second entry
.
. 
.
N+1th line contains the register number of n-th entry
Next line contains the register number  ‘r’ that has to be searched
Output Format:
A list without duplicate entries
Print either ‘Found’ or ‘Not found’
Boundary Conditions:
Number of students visited >=0
