Q)  Write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program to check whether the given 
    matrix is sparse or not. A matrix is said to be a “Sparse” if the number  of 
    zero entries  in the matrix,  is greater than or equal to the number  of non-zero
    entries. Otherwise it is  “Not sparse”. Check for boundary conditions and print 
    'Invalid input' when not satisfied.

Input Format:
The first line will contain the number of rows in the matrix, rows
The Second line will contain the number of columns in the matrix, cols
The next (rows * cols) lines will contain the elements of the matrix, 
entered row wise
Output Format:
Print either Sparse or Not sparse
Boundary Conditions:
Number of rows and columns > 0
