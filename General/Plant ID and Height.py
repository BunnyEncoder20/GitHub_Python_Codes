Q)  A gardener has the practice of assigning ID to the plants during plantation. 
    One day, he makes a note of the heights of plants in his garden. He writes the
    height of the plant against the ID of the plant. He then instructs his employee 
    to keep the plants, in ascending order of its height. Design an algorithm and 
    write the Python code to display the list of ID numbers of plants in ascending 
    order of their height. IDs are also numbers. Check for boundary conditions and 
    print 'Invalid input' for wrong input. For example, if there are three trees 
    with IDs as 175, 160, 120 and height as 47, 73 and 23 then the output should be 
    [120, 175, 160].

Input Format:
First line contains the number of plants, n
Next line contains the ID of the plant-1
Next line contains the height of plant-1
. 
.
.
Next line contains the ID of the plant-n
Next line contains the height of plantn

Output Format:
IDs sorted according to height. Print one id in one line
Boundary Conditions:
All inputs >=0
